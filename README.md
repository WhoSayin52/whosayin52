# Hello World 💻

I'm a self-taught developer passionate about web and graphics programming. I enjoy building projects from scratch and contributing to open-source software.
Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in **OpenGL** and always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks.

Outside coding, I enjoy **strategy games**, **math puzzles**, and **fitness**—I believe in training both the mind and the body.
